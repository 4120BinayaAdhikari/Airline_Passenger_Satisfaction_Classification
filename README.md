# Airline_Passenger_Satisfaction_Classification
In the given problem of classifying airline passenger satisfaction, I have applied multiple machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, SVM, PCA, and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).

I evaluated the models based on their accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score, and generated classification reports for each model.

Based on the evaluation metrics, I can see that the Random Forest model performs the best with an accuracy of 0.95, precision of 0.95, recall of 0.95, and an f1 score of 0.95. The Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes models also perform well, with accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 scores all above 0.85.

However, it's important to note that the performance of the models may vary based on the specific dataset used and the evaluation metrics chosen. Therefore, it's always recommended to evaluate multiple models and select the one that performs the best for specific problem and needs.

In conclusion, based on the evaluation metrics and classification reports generated for the models above, I recommend the Random Forest model as the best model for classifying airline passenger satisfaction in this dataset.
